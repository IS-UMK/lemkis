# Task 

The task involves workers producing and consuming `units` of a specific `type`. Implement this task using processes in c++. Below is the detailed explanation (beware that the following code is oversimplified and sometimes even pseudo-code is given):

---

## Concept

1. **Unit**:
   - Units are of `R` types
   - The type of a unit can be checked using the function:
     ```cpp
     using unit = int;
     using unit_type = int;
      unit_type type(const unit& u) {
          return u; // Correct this - remember there are R types
      }
     ```

2. **Workers**:
   - There are `N` workers.
   - Each worker has the following behavior:
     1. Produces a unit using the function:
        ```cpp
         auto produce() -> unit{
             static int counter = 0;
             u = counter++ % 5; // Produces units of 5 types (0 to 4) - make it random
             std::println("Produced: {}", u);
           return u;
         }
        ```
     2. Sends the unit to an intermediary process (`Helper`), which facilitates communication between workers.
     3. Receives a unit of the same type, produced by another worker, and consumes it using the function:
        ```cpp
         void consume(const unit& u) {
             std::println("Consumed: {}", u);
         }
        ```

4. **Assumptions**:
   - Each worker produces an infinite number of units of all types.
   - Units are passed between workers through helper processes (`Helper`).

5. **Helper Processes**:
   - Helpers are implemented as an `N`-element array.
   - Each `Helper[i]` can only:
     - Send messages to its associated worker.
     - Send messages to the next helper in a circular manner, i.e., `Helper[(i + 1) % N]`.

## Goal

The goal is to implement the `Helper` processes, assuming that workers follow this algorithm:

```plaintext
process Worker[id : 1..N] {
    while (true) {
        unit u = produce();
        send Helper[id].exchange(u);
        receive u;
        consume(u);
    }
}
```

Apart from correctness of your solution - you should be able to explain to your classmates you solution and reveal what problems you have encountered during develepment of your solution (if no such  then please explain potential problems with the "most obvious solution"). Stick to the requirements i have sent you via email (in particular take care of style). In this task, you are **not allowed to** use external libraries.
