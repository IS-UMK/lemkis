# When to Use Different IPC Mechanisms

Each Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism has specific strengths and ideal use cases. Here's a comprehensive comparison of when to prefer one over the others:

## Pipes

**Best for:**
- Parent-child process communication
- Simple one-way data streaming
- Command pipelining (as in shell commands like `cmd1 | cmd2`)
- Short-lived processes working together

**Advantages:**
- Simple to set up and use
- Built into most system calls and shells
- No external naming or cleanup required
- Good for streaming data

**Limitations:**
- Only works between related processes (parent-child)
- Unidirectional (need two pipes for bidirectional)
- Limited buffer size
- No random access to data

**Example scenario:** A parent process that launches a child process to perform calculations and read the results sequentially.

## FIFOs (Named Pipes)

**Best for:**
- Communication between unrelated processes
- Client-server patterns with simple protocols
- When persistence beyond process lifetime isn't needed
- When you need pipe-like semantics but between unrelated processes

**Advantages:**
- Works between any processes on the same machine
- Accessible via filesystem path
- Simple read/write interface
- No need for complex synchronization

**Limitations:**
- Still unidirectional (need two for bidirectional)
- Limited buffer size
- No message boundaries (just a byte stream)
- Blocking by default

**Example scenario:** A logging service that multiple applications can write to via a known FIFO path.

## Message Queues

**Best for:**
- Asynchronous communication with discrete messages
- When message boundaries and priorities matter
- Producer-consumer patterns
- When message persistence is important
- Multiple senders/receivers

**Advantages:**
- Preserves message boundaries
- Supports priorities
- Can be persistent across reboots (System V)
- Handles multiple readers/writers cleanly
- Better flow control than pipes

**Limitations:**
- More complex API than pipes
- Limited message size
- May need manual cleanup

**Example scenario:** A task distribution system where jobs need to be processed in priority order by worker processes, or when building a work queue that multiple producers can add tasks to and multiple consumers can take tasks from.

## Shared Memory

**Best for:**
- High-performance data sharing
- Large data volumes
- Complex data structures
- When minimal copying is essential
- Real-time applications

**Advantages:**
- Fastest IPC mechanism (zero-copy)
- Supports random access to data
- Can handle very large data sets
- Flexible structure (you define the layout)

**Limitations:**
- Requires explicit synchronization (semaphores, mutexes)
- Complex to manage safely
- Potential for race conditions
- More difficult error handling

**Example scenario:** A video processing application that needs to share frame buffers between capture, processing, and display processes without copying large amounts of memory.

## Semaphores

**Best for:**
- Synchronization between processes
- Protecting shared resources
- Coordinating access patterns
- Implementing producer-consumer patterns
- Complementing shared memory

**Advantages:**
- Atomic operations
- Can coordinate multiple processes
- Support for counting (resources) and binary (mutex) patterns
- Built-in queuing for waiters

**Limitations:**
- Not for data transfer (synchronization only)
- Can lead to deadlocks if misused
- Need careful design to prevent race conditions

**Example scenario:** Coordinating access to a shared memory segment, ensuring that writers don't interfere with readers, or implementing a bounded buffer with producer and consumer processes.

## Signals

**Best for:**
- Asynchronous notifications
- Event-driven programming
- Process control (start, stop, resume)
- Error handling
- Timeout implementation

**Advantages:**
- Lightweight
- Can interrupt normal flow
- System-wide delivery mechanism
- Standard way to notify about exceptional conditions

**Limitations:**
- Limited information transfer (just the signal number)
- Can be lost if process isn't ready
- Complex handling with reentrant code
- Limited number of available signals

**Example scenario:** Notifying a process that it should gracefully shut down (SIGTERM), or implementing a timeout mechanism for long-running operations.

## Comparison for Specific Requirements

### When Performance Is Critical:
1. **Shared memory** is fastest for large data
2. **Pipes** for simple streaming between related processes
3. **Message queues** when you need message boundaries with reasonable performance

### When Reliability Is Critical:
1. **Message queues** with persistence
2. **FIFOs** with proper error handling
3. **Shared memory** with robust synchronization

### When Simplicity Is Critical:
1. **Pipes** for related processes
2. **FIFOs** for unrelated processes
3. **Signals** for simple notifications

### For Distributed Systems:
None of these are suitable across machines - you'd need:
- Network sockets
- Distributed message queues
- Remote procedure calls
